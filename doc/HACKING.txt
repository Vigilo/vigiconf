Coding style
------------
When hacking on VigiConf, please respect these two documents:
- PEP-8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- Code like a pythonista : 
  http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html
(yes, these two document overlap, but please read both)

The code is being moved from mixedCase to the more standard Python
recommandation, so in the meantime you may find both styles. Sorry about that.


Documentation
-------------
Please use docstrings as often as possible (and reasonable). The API
documentation will be generated using Epydoc (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net).

The epytext syntax is preferred, but reStrucuredText is allowed if you specify
the __docformat__ variable. See the Epydoc manual for details.

At some point, we may move our documentation to Sphinx
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org), but not yet.
