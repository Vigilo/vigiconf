This is the README file for ConfMgr.

ConfMgr is part of the Vigilo project.

ConfMgr acts as a configuration generator, validator and dispatcher for
several softwares (in parethesis are vigilo modules) that share a common 
data referential:
  * Nagios
  * StoreMe (a RRD store)
  * RRDGraph (a RRD Graph generator)
  * Collector (an highly optimized SNMP Nagios plugin)
  * Nagvis
  * CorrSup (an event correlation system)
  * SupNav (a graphical frontend to Nagios, and RRDGraph)
  * bind
  * Apache2 (as a Reverse proxy configuration generator)
  * CorrTrap (an SNMP Trap receiver and translator)
  * Perf2Store (a PerfData to StoreMe router)

All data definition comes from a single model, described as a bunch of
Python files contained in a directory. Data definition decribes the
following:
  * hosts
  * host groups
  * supervision servers in charge of hosts groups
  * services associated with hosts
  * the way the services are collected (passively, directlyâ€¦)
  * SNMP jobs that are to be scheduled for a give host
  * data sources related to data collected from SNMP Jobs or Nagios' perf
data
  * graphes that contain several data sources on a single image

ConfMgr uses SVN as a configuration versionning system and rely on SSH
and sudo to copy configuration files, launch command (to validate a
configuration file validity, stop/start/restart deamons).
After installing this package, you need to extract the configuration and
templates directories from the subversion repository.
See /etc/vigilo-vigiconf/conf.d/README.source for the subversion repository address
This should be done as the "vigiconf" user.

A full forced configuration dispatch is done by calling "dispatchator"
