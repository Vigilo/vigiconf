The configuration in this directory should be managed in SVN
The address of the SVN repository could be something like:
http://supserver.example.com/svn/vigilo/trunk/conf.d/

Then activate the Rev keyword on the file conf.d/general/apps.py by the
following command:
svn propset svn:keywords Rev conf.d/general/apps.py
